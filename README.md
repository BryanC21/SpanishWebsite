# SpanishWebsite

Created for final class project
Made using: HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap

This website is intended to help teach people Spanish. It provides short lessons, quizzes and flashcards for practice. 
The quiz, flashcard and lesson pages are made using templates which then have the information filled in depending on which section/lesson the user clicked and this is tracked using the URL and JavaScript.
